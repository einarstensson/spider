<h1>Spider</h1>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>I wanted to explore using PHP to build web crawlers and what advantages and disadvantages that would entail.</p>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<p>+ Because PHP is so well suited for communicating across domains, it is realtively easy to use it to fetch HTML. In particular, I used the simple_html_dom.pg library and the file_get_html($url);</p>
